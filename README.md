# Reflection
This challenge was hard and required some outside tutoring to complete. However, I am glad that I attened the tutoring session because it allowed me to understand further how 
JavaScript works. As difficult as this challenge was I am also glad that there was plenty of research avialable through 3WSchools,Mozilla, and various Youtube creators.
